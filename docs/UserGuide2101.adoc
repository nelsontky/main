into 4 different parts: the different tabs present in the
program (Coupons, Summary, and Help), the calendar,
the command input box and the command result box.

each tab of Coupon Stash, as well as how to use them.

[[couponstab]]

overview of the coupons which you have added to the

====

[NOTE]

when they have the same name, promo code, expiry date, and savings.

<<<
==== Summary tab

The summary tab provides an overview of how much
you have saved from using coupons in Coupon Stash.

This tab provides an estimate of all the savings you have accumulated from
the usage of coupons that are still present in Coupon Stash
(Including <<archive, archived>> coupons).
This estimate is displayed in the form of a monetary amount at the
top of the page, with saved items that may not be easily
quantified displayed in a lime-green box at the side,
preceded by the text "And these saveables too!".

.Coupon Stash summary tab.
image::ug_summary_tab.png[width=75%]

A graph that shows the monetary amount saved
every week is also displayed in the summary tab.
The next section will tell you more about how to
interpret this graph.

===== Savings graph

The savings graph provides a bar chart which holds
statistics on the amount of money saved per week.
The taller the bar, the more savings earned that week.
The exact amount is also shown in white text at the
top of each bar.

In the graph, Monday is taken to be the first day
of a week, and Sunday the last. The date displayed
on the bottom axis corresponds to the first day of that
week (Monday). Earlier weeks are displayed on
the left, while later weeks are displayed on the right (direction of time axis
is from left to right).

The graph is drawn based on the latest week in which
coupon usage was recorded by Coupon Stash, and shows
a maximum of 10 bars or 10 weeks of savings before that
latest date.

[TIP]
Any savings that were recorded by Coupon Stash before
the time period of 10 weeks will not be shown in the graph.
However, they can still be calculated using the
<<saved, saved command>>.

[[archive]]
=== Archiving a coupon: `archive` (Chester)

current stash of coupons.

[NOTE]

keywords below unarchived coupons. Finally, the
<<Listing all expiring coupons: `expiring` (Denise), `expiring`>> command will also

=== Unarchiving a coupon: `unarchive` (Chester)

name in your coupon name!

Examples:

* `find ken` +
For example, coupons with the keyword **ken** would be returned: +
**Ken** Kitchen, **KEN** RIDGE Optical, **ken** you build a snowman.

[NOTE]
The <<Finding coupons by name: `find`, `find`>> command searches the
<<Archiving a coupon: `archive` (Chester), `archive`>> for matches too. Coupons that are

non-archived matches.

// end::find[]

// tag::expiring[]
=== Listing all expiring coupons: `expiring` (Denise)

month year on display in the
<<calendar, calendar>> to September 2020.

Format: `expiring e/EXPIRY_DATE` or `expiring my/MONTH_YEAR`

****
* The <<coupon-stash-date-format, expiry date>> or <<coupon-stash-monthyear-format, month year>> must follow the

// end::exit[]

// tag::reminding[]
=== Reminding of coupon expiry (Kevin)

By default, all added coupons have a remind date that is 3 days before its
stated expiry date. This default value can be changed during the process of
adding a new coupon or by editing an existing coupon. The remind dates for all
coupons are checked on program launch. All coupons that have a remind date which
falls on the date of program launch will be listed in a popup window on launch.
The popup window can be closed by pressing kbd:[Ctrl] + kbd:[q].

.Popup window showing all coupons that have their remind dates set on the date of program launch.
image::ug_reminder_window.PNG[]

[WARNING]
Remind dates are **only** checked during program launch. Thus, if a day passes
while the program is open, even if there are coupons expiring on the new day,
no new reminder window will open.

As of now, there is no
functionality for the disabling of reminders for coupons. This feature will be
made available in version 2.0.

====
* The format of dates entered via the `r/` field is
in the D-M-YYYY format. (<<coupon-stash-date-format, Coupon Stash date format>>)
====

Examples:

* `add n/McDonald's McGriddles p/ILOVEMCGRIDDLES e/31-12-2020 s/$2
   sd/1-4-2020 l/2 t/value t/savoury`
+
Add a new Coupon without specifying a remind date. Note that the default
remind date is 3 days before the state expiry date:
+

image::ug_mcdonalds_mcgriddles.png[]

* `add n/Grabfood s/40% e/30-4-2020 p/GRAB40 t/delivery r/10-4-2020`
+
Add a new Coupon while specifying a remind date of `10-04-2020`:

image::ug_Grabfood_reminder.png[]

* `edit 1 r/10-4-2020`
+
Edit the coupon at index 1 and change its remind date to `10-4-2020`.

// end::reminding[]

=== Saving the data

command that changes the data.

There is no need to save manually.

[[KeyboardShortcuts]]
== Keyboard Shortcuts
With Coupon Stash being optimized for efficient command line usage, how can we
not include some nifty keyboard shortcuts to further streamline
your workflow! This section introduces some of the keyboard shortcuts available
for use in this program.

=== Restore previously entered command texts: kbd:[↑] and kbd:[↓] (Nelson)
Pressing the kbd:[↑] keyboard button while the focus is on the command box
allows you to restore the text of the previous executed command. Pressing
the kbd:[↓] keyboard button allows you to revert to a more recently entered
command.

Here is a scenario where restoring previously entered command texts with the
kbd:[↑] and kbd:[↓] keys will be useful:

. Suppose you ran these 3 commands in order in Coupon Stash:
* `edit 1 n/ Adidas 31 Percent`
+
.Before running the `edit` command.
image::keyboard_shortcuts/updownedit.png[]
+
* `archive 2`
+
.Before running the `archive` command.
image::keyboard_shortcuts/updownarchive.png[]
* `add n/McDonald's McGriddles p/ILOVEMCGRIDDLES e/31-12-2020 s/50% sd/1-4-2020 l/2 t/Value t/Savoury`
+
.Before running the `add` command.
image::keyboard_shortcuts/updownadd.png[]

. We realise that in the first command we ran (the `edit` command), we
renamed the first coupon wrongly.
+
.Name was edited erroneously, should be "Adidas 30 Percent" instead of "Adidas 31 Percent".
image::keyboard_shortcuts/updownwrongname.png[]

. To save ourselves the hassle of retyping the entire `edit` command again,
we can access the previously entered command via the kbd:[↑] keyboard button.
. Press kbd:[↑] thrice to retrieve the `edit` command.
* We press kbd:[↑] thrice as the `edit` command was run three commands ago.

+
.`edit` command restored after pressing kbd:[↑] thrice.
image::keyboard_shortcuts/updownretrivee.png[]

. Next, we can change ``edit``'s name parameter from "Adidas 31 Percent" to
"Adidas 30 Percent", before executing the command again.

+
.Amended name parameter.
image::keyboard_shortcuts/updownchangedname.png[]
+
.Adidas coupon amended successfully.
image::keyboard_shortcuts/updownfinal.png[]

[NOTE]
Just as kbd:[↑] can be used to navigate the command history, kbd:[↓] can be
used to navigate towards the more recent entries in the command history.

=== Close expanded coupon or reminder windows: kbd:[Ctrl]+kbd:[q] (Nelson)
After <<expand, expanding>> a coupon, you can close
the expanded coupon window by keeping the focus on the coupon window and
pressing the keyboard buttons kbd:[Ctrl] and kbd:[q] simultaneously. This
shortcut also works for closing <<_reminding_of_coupon_expiry, reminder>>
windows.

=== Cycle through tabs: kbd:[Ctrl]+kbd:[Tab] (Nelson)
You can press the keyboard buttons kbd:[Ctrl] and kbd:[Tab] simultaneously to
switch tabs. Do note that the focus has to be on the main panel before the
key presses would work.
